// control, the terminal and the exit status all belong to the harness directly,
// with no wrapper in between to get them subtly wrong. Ctrl-C reaches the agent
// rather than killing reach and orphaning it.
//
// But execve is not universally available. Go stubs syscall.Exec on Windows to
// return EWINDOWS unconditionally, and it can fail on Unix too — ETXTBSY when
// the binary is being written, or under a sandbox that forbids it. Two of the
// three call sites used to print that error and exit, which turned "this
// platform has no execve" into "reach is broken" with no route forward. Falling
// back to a child process is worse in the ways described above, and enormously
// better than not starting.

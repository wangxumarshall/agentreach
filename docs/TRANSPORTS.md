# File-operation tiers

AgentReach separates *how it reaches a target* (transport: SSH, Docker, Podman) from *how it performs file operations on that target* (tier). The tier is negotiated automatically based on what the target supports. You can also pin a specific tier with `--fileops=<tier>`, and `reach doctor` reports which tiers a given host qualifies for and why.

The key guarantee: **tier 0 works on any host running stock `sshd` and requires nothing installed, nothing written to disk, and nothing beyond a login shell.** Higher tiers are optimisations, never requirements.

> **For most users:** you do not need to think about tiers. `reach up` negotiates the best option and records it. If you want to audit what was chosen, `reach status` tells you. If you want to ensure nothing is written to the target, `--fileops=posix` or `--fileops=pipe` guarantees it.

| tier | name | remote requirement | writes to remote disk |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `posix` | a POSIX shell | none |
| 1 | `pipe` | `python3` present | none |
| 2 | `helper` | ability to execute an uploaded binary | one cached binary |

**Every tier answers one file operation in one network round trip.** That is the
rule the set is chosen by, not an accident of which protocols were available —
see [Why there is no SFTP tier](#why-there-is-no-sftp-tier).

## What they actually cost

Measured twice, because the first measurement was taken in the wrong place.

Both tables drive reach through its CLI, one process per operation, which is how
a harness drives it. Reproduce with `make bench`, or against your own host with
`REACH_BENCH_SSH_HOST=my-box make bench`.

**At zero latency**, the tiers are not really what is being measured. Same
machine, same `local://` transport, same work — only the operating system
differs:

| 40 × 1 KiB read | macOS arm64 | Linux x86_64 |
|---|---|---|
| `posix` | 1.47 s | **0.20 s** |
| `pipe` | 1.94 s | 0.87 s |
| `helper` | 0.95 s | 0.47 s |

Tier 0 is 7× more expensive on the macOS target, and reach's own startup is not
the reason — 40 invocations of `reach version` take 0.13 s. The cause is that
tier 0 spawns a process per read on the target, and macOS creates processes far
more slowly than Linux. A loopback benchmark therefore mostly measures the
target's process spawner. Useful to know — **if your target is macOS, tier 0
costs disproportionately more** — but not what should decide anything.

**Over a real link**, a host ~171 ms per command, median of three runs:

| tier | 15 × 1 KiB read | 8 MiB read | 8 MiB write |
|---|---|---|---|
| `posix` | 5.83 s | 6.39 s | 6.79 s |
| `pipe` | 4.08 s | 5.19 s | **5.43 s** |
| `helper` | **3.93 s** | **5.16 s** | 5.53 s |

`pipe` and `helper` land within noise of each other, which is what should
happen: they are the same protocol with a different program on the far end.
`posix` trails on bulk because it pipes content through a shell, and on small
reads because it spawns processes per operation — a gap that widens sharply on
a macOS target, where process creation is expensive.

The `helper` row is worth a note. It used to read **10.83 s** here, the slowest
tier by a wide margin, and the reason was not the binary: before touching a file
it asked the target where its cache directory was, then asked the installed
binary to identify itself, and only then did the work. Three round trips to
answer one question. The cache directory is now reported by the capability
probe, and the identity is verified once per session rather than once per tool
call. Same binary, same protocol, a third of the time.

## Tier 0 — `posix` (strict SSH, universal)

For targets where **nothing may be installed** and only shell access exists.
Every operation is an ordinary command over the SSH connection:

| op | implementation |
|---|---|
| read | `tail -c +N \| head -c M`, raw when the link is 8-bit clean |
| write | `> <tmp> && mv <tmp> <path>` (atomic rename), raw when clean |
| stat | `stat -c` / BSD `stat -f` |
| list | GNU `find -printf` with NUL records, else `find -exec stat` |
| search | `rg --json` if present, else `grep -rn` |
| glob | `find` with `-path` or `-name` |
| mkdir/rename/remove | `mkdir -p` / `mv` / `rm` |

Binary-safe in both directions, and only pays for it when it has to. reach
proves the link is 8-bit clean during `reach up` — piping every byte value
through the target's own digest command in one direction, and having the target
print them back in the other — and moves content unencoded when it is. A
transport that garbles anything keeps base64, which is unconditionally safe and
costs a third of the bandwidth.

That measurement is not decoration. It is why this tier reads an 8 MiB file
faster than the SFTP tier did, which is most of the reason that tier no longer
exists.

Reads and writes are offset-addressed, so a dropped connection resumes rather
than restarts.

`dd bs=1` is deliberately not used for ranges: it issues one syscall per byte,
which makes a large offset pathologically slow.

This tier is the floor, and the fallback whenever nothing higher can be proven.

## Tier 1 — `pipe`

A stdlib-only Python handler runs on the target and speaks a length-framed
protocol over one long-lived channel. **Nothing is ever written to the remote
filesystem** — the handler exists only in the memory of a process that dies with
the session.

The obvious design, `ssh host 'python3 -' < handler.py`, cannot work: the
interpreter reads its program from stdin until EOF, leaving no stdin for the
protocol afterwards. reach instead runs a one-line bootstrap that decodes the
handler from the first line of stdin and executes it, so everything after that
newline is protocol:

```console
ssh host "exec python3 -c 'import sys,base64;exec(compile(base64.b64decode(sys.stdin.buffer.readline()),\"<reach>\",\"exec\"))'"
```

File content travels as a raw payload beside the JSON header rather than inside
it, so binary files cross the wire unencoded and no text codec can mangle a NUL
byte or invalid UTF-8. Digests are computed on the target, so a file that has
not changed never crosses the network at all.

`exec` replaces the shell with the interpreter, so closing the channel kills the
handler rather than leaving an orphan on someone else's machine.

## Tier 2 — `helper` (auto-installed)

Never chosen automatically, and no longer for performance reasons — it is the
fastest tier for small reads. It is opt-in because it writes a binary to a
machine the operator may not own, which is a decision reach does not make for
them.

A small static Go binary, installed by reach when this tier is selected. The
user is never asked to install anything by hand. It speaks the identical
protocol to tier 1 — one client serves both, because a second implementation
would be a second thing to keep honest.

This is the only tier that writes to a target, so everything about it is built
to be verifiable and reversible:

1. `uname -sm` resolves the target's OS and architecture. An unrecognised
   platform is an error, not a guess: a wrong guess leaves an unrunnable binary
   on a host that was supposed to stay untouched.
2. reach looks for a build for that platform beside its own binary (release
   archives ship them), then in `~/.reach/helper/`, then cross-compiles one with
   the local Go toolchain from a source checkout. `REACH_HELPER_BINARY`
   overrides all of that with one you built yourself. Nothing is downloaded at
   run time: a tool that exists to touch nothing should not be fetching
   executables over the network to put on a client's server.
3. The binary is uploaded **using tier 0**, to
   `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/reach/helper-<version>-<os>-<arch>` on the
   target. Bootstrapping the fast tier with the universal one means installation
   works on exactly the hosts reach can already reach.
4. `reach-helper --selftest` prints its version, a digest of itself, and its
   platform. reach compares all three against the file it just sent, and
   reinstalls rather than trusting a mismatch. Version alone would accept a
   truncated upload; a digest alone would accept a binary left behind by a
   different release.

Properties:

- **Self-updating.** The version is part of the path, so an upgraded reach
  installs a new helper rather than reusing a stale one.
- **Visible.** `reach doctor` lists exactly what reach has placed on the host,
  and says plainly when it has placed nothing.
- **Removable.** `reach helper uninstall` deletes the cache directory. That path
  is derived by reach, never from anything the target said.
- **Never automatic.** Autonegotiation stops below this tier, so reaching it
  takes `--fileops=helper` and nothing else. Writing to someone else's machine
  stays an explicit operator decision.

Set `REACH_HELPER_BINARY` to use a build you produced yourself.

## Negotiation

```console
reach up host:/srv/app                  # negotiate the best proven tier
reach up host:/srv/app --fileops=posix  # pin tier 0 — install nothing, touch nothing
reach up host:/srv/app --fileops=helper  # opt in to the auto-installed helper
```

Negotiation order is `pipe`, then `posix`, chosen by measurement against a real
link rather than loopback — see
[What they actually cost](#what-they-actually-cost). It never selects `helper`,
the only tier that writes anything to the target.

Two rules make the outcome trustworthy:

- **A pinned tier is never substituted.** If `--fileops=pipe` cannot be built —
  no `python3` on the target — reach fails and explains why rather than quietly
  handing you `posix`. Reporting a tier the session is not using is a lie the
  operator would act on.
- **An autonegotiated tier may degrade, but never silently.** The fallback and
  its reason are printed, recorded in the session, and shown by `reach status`.

The tier is not merely chosen during `reach up` — it is *built* once, to prove
it works. Recording a tier that turns out to be unusable would move the failure
out of `reach up`, where an operator is present to act on it, and into the
middle of an agent's turn, where it looks like a broken tool.

## Why there is no SFTP tier

reach had one, and removing it is the most useful thing this document records.

SFTP is the one structured file protocol every stock `sshd` already speaks, so a
tier built on it promised faster file access with nothing installed. It was
implemented, tested, measured — and then deleted, for two reasons that only
became clear once it was measured on a real network.

**It cannot answer a tool call in one round trip.** `READ` takes a handle, and
the handle only exists in `OPEN`'s response. That dependency is in the protocol,
so no amount of pipelining removes it: `OPEN` and `STAT` can share a round trip
because both take a path, but `READ` cannot join them, and version 3 has no
composite open-and-read. Two was the floor. Every surviving tier does it in one —
the shell tier sends a command and reads its output, the pipe and helper tiers
send a request and read a response.

**Its remaining advantage was bandwidth, and that turned out to be reach's own
fault.** Tier 0 base64-encoded file content unconditionally, which costs a third
of the bandwidth, and SFTP did not. Once reach started *proving* whether a link
is 8-bit clean and skipping the encoding when it is, the shell tier read 8 MiB
in 6.4 s against SFTP's 8.1 s, and matched it on small reads and writes. The
tier that existed to beat the shell on file content no longer beat it on any
axis.

What it cost while it lived: several hundred lines of hand-written protocol, and
three bugs — temporary filenames that collided between processes, writes that
were not pipelined and so took 79 s to move 8 MiB over a slow link, and four
serial round trips per read. All three were mistakes the shell tier's simplicity
makes impossible.

If you need file access on a target with no `python3` and nothing installable,
that is tier 0, and it is now as fast. If you want request/response without
`python3`, that is `--fileops=helper`, at the cost of the one thing reach will
not do silently: writing a binary to the target.

## Conformance

The three tiers share almost no code, and a user cannot tell which is in use. So
all three run one identical suite (`internal/fileops/fileopstest`) covering NUL
bytes, invalid UTF-8, CRLF, empty files, 5 MiB payloads, offset reads, awkward
filenames, atomic overwrite, and not-found reporting.

`test/integration` runs that same suite over a real sshd and adds the property
that matters most: a file written through any tier reads back byte-for-byte
through every other, with matching digests. A tier that cannot pass does not
ship.

// Connection multiplexing is the single largest performance difference between
// the platforms reach runs on, so it is decided by evidence rather than by an
// assumption compiled into the binary.
//
// On Unix, OpenSSH's ControlMaster keeps one authenticated connection alive and
// runs later commands as new channels on it: ~7 ms per command against ~130 ms
// for a cold connect, and one authentication instead of one per tool call.
// reach's whole "no daemon" argument rests on it — a daemon would buy exactly
// this and nothing else.
//
// Win32-OpenSSH does not implement it. The mux protocol passes file descriptors
// over a Unix domain socket, which Windows has no equivalent for, so the
// feature is absent rather than merely unconfigured. reach therefore starts
// without the options on Windows and probes: it never sends a client an option
// that might make it refuse the connection, and if a future Windows OpenSSH
// gains multiplexing, reach will find it and use it with no code change.

// muxProbeTimeout bounds the probe. Tier and capability decisions must always
// terminate: an unanswerable question is a value reach records, not a wait.
const muxProbeTimeout = 20 * time.Second

// interactiveProbeTimeout bounds a probe that may put a prompt in front of an
// operator. Twenty seconds is generous for a machine and short for a person
// finding a hardware token.
const interactiveProbeTimeout = 3 * time.Minute

// DetectMultiplexing reports whether the local ssh client can hold a
// multiplexed master connection to this destination, and why not when it
// cannot.
//
// It proves the answer by establishing one and asking the client to confirm it,
// rather than by inspecting a version string: a version tells you what was
// compiled in, not what a `Match` block, a hardened configuration or a
// restricted socket directory will permit at run time.

	// a password or a hardware token cannot be supplied in batch mode, so the
	// probe failed, reach recorded "no multiplexing", and every later tool call

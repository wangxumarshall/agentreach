// localShell resolves the shell used by a local:// target.

// A local:// target means "this machine is the target", and reach's floor is a
// POSIX shell — so on Windows this asks for something the platform does not
// have. It is deliberately not satisfied by whatever bash happens to be on
// PATH: a stray Git for Windows installation would quietly turn a Windows
// machine into a target, where MSYS path translation makes every absolute path
// mean something different from what the caller wrote.
//
// Setting REACH_LOCAL_SHELL makes it a deliberate act by someone who knows what
// they are pointing reach at. The ordinary Windows arrangement — reach and the
// agent on Windows, driving a remote POSIX host — needs none of this.
